- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js allows rendering React components on the server before sending them to the client, improving performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** It pre-renders pages at build time, useful for blogs or e-commerce sites.
- **API Routes:** You can build a backend using API routes in the same codebase without needing an external server.
- **File-Based Routing:** Next.js automatically creates routes based on the file structure inside the `pages` directory.
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** Like React, Next.js also supports traditional client-side rendering.
- **Image Optimization:** Built-in image optimization capabilities that reduce image sizes and enhance loading times.
- **Automatic Code Splitting:** Next.js splits the code into smaller bundles, which are loaded only when required, improving performance.
- **TypeScript Support:** Native support for TypeScript, enabling strict typing and better developer experience.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):** Pages can be statically generated at runtime and updated incrementally.
- **Fast Refresh:** Provides an instant feedback loop while coding, similar to React's hot reloading.
